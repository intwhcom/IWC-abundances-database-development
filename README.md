# IWC-abundances-database-development
This repository holds the code, schema and data used to develop a postgreSQL database that holds population abundance estimates discussed and endorsed by IWC.

The data, currently are held CSV, flat files, and excel files, are being moved into a PostgeSQL database to facilitate querying the data, disseminating and communicating them.
